# sql-challenge

I am very familiar with SQL already, as I currently use it on a daily basis in my job. So I didn't struggle as much with the data analysis portion of this challenge. That said, all of my SQL experience has been working with data that has already been ingested and cleaned by my company's data engineers, so creating new tables (with all the appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and NOT NULL designations) is still new to me. Data modeling an ERG was also new to me, and I had to continually reference class materials while I designed the model. While it was helpful to have the diagram largely finished before moving on to the data engineering portion, I found that I had to go back and change the diagram, particularly the arrows, as I created the SQL tables in PGAdmin.
